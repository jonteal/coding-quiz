# Game of Thrones Quiz
## Description

This application is a quiz to test the player's trivial knowledge of the HBO series
Game of Thrones. It gives the player the opportunity to enjoy a playful user experience 
by its display of red when questions are answered wrong and a light blue when they are 
answered correctly. The quiz is also timed, and so the player must reach the last question 
and get as few answers wrong as possible to achieve the highest score they can.


## Usage

To play the game, the player must hit the "Start" button, at which point the first question
is displayed. They must then answer each question by selecting the option they think is correct,
followed by the "Next" button to progress to the next question. If they get an answer right, 
the screen will flash blue to signal a correct response, and they may proceed to the next question. However, if they player selects the wrong answer, 10 seconds will be subtracted from 
the remaining time, which will ultimately negatively impact their score. Once they answer the last
question, however many seconds that are remaining will then be used as their score. If they answer too many questions wrong, or the time runs out, they will receive a score of O. Once the game ends, the player can enter in their initials to be saved.


## Credits
I worked on this during several sessions with a fellow cohort member, Jackson Barker, and we shared ideas on several sections. Ultimately our work didn't follow the same path, but I would like to disclose that. I also used concepts shared in a mini project that was taught to us during our week where we focused on API's.
